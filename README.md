# PracticalMachineLearning_Project
Course Project for the Practical Machine Learning Course in the John Hopkin's Data Science Specialization.

The goal of this project is to apply machine learning algorithms learned in the course to create a prediction model. This model will be applied to a validation set (`testing`), and the resulting predictions are verified for correctness. 

Further info on the project, data used, and references can be found in the Executive Summary of the `Project Writeup` Rmarkdown file.
